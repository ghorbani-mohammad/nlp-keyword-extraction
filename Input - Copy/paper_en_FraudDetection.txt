Credit card fraud detection is an essential part of screening fraudulent transactions in advance of their authorization by card issuers 
Although credit card frauds occur extremely infrequently, they result in huge losses as most fraudulent transactions have large values 
An adequate detection of fraud allows investigators to take timely actions that can potentially prevent additional fraud or financial losses
In practice, however, investigators can only check a few alerts per day since the investigation process can be long and tedious
Thus, the primary goal of the fraud detection model is to return accurate alerts with fewer false alarms and missed frauds 
Conventional fraud detection is mainly based on the hybrid ensemble of diverse machine learning models
Recently, several studies have compared deep learning and traditional machine learning models including ensemble 
However, these studies used evaluation methods without considering that the real-world fraud detection system operated with the constraints 
the number of investigators who check the high-risk transactions from the data-driven scoring models are limited 
the two types of misclassification, false alarms and missed frauds, have different costs 
In this study, we conducted an in-depth comparison between the hybrid ensemble and deep learning method to determine whether or not to adopt the latter in our partner’s system that currently operates with the hybrid ensemble model
To compare the two, we introduced the champion-challenger framework and the development process of the two models 
After developing the two models, we evaluated them on large transaction data sets taken from our partner, a major card issuing company in South Korea 
We used various practical evaluation metrics appropriate for this domain that has severe class and cost imbalances 
Moreover, we deployed these models in a real-world fraud detection system to check the post-launch performance for one month 
The challenger outperformed the champion on both in off-line and post-launch tests
